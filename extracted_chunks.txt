EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This report covers the Developments done Exclusively for Kirti Group while 
implementing IEV-ERP. The report has 2 parts as below: 
1st Section : Kirti Agrovet Limited  (Edible OIL Business)  
2nd Section: Kirti Udyog (De-Oiled Cake or DOC business) 
Kirti Group, is India‟s leading global player in edible oil market, the group‟s crushing 
capacity stands at around 5,500 Tons/Day with crushing units at Latur, Nanded, 
Solapur,  Hingoli in Maharashtra and Bijapur in Karnataka. There are six 
companies under the group: while Kirti Agrovet/Agrotech/Dal Mills/Oil/Gold are
engaged in the business of Edible Oil of different types, grades, packing specs or 
loose. The companies are engaged in domestic sales as well as foreign trade. The
flagship brand for edible oil is „Kirti GOLD‟. Kirti Udyog is engaged in the business 
of De-oiled Cake (DOC) and other products like Purses, Besan etc.  most of it is 
sourced from the group companies as above. 
There are many systems in use for doing various sales/purchase transactions as 
also for updating the books of accounts like Logi-BRICKS, Tally etc. Also, there are 
some Mobile Apps KISAN-Kirti for Seed purchase as well as for warehouse 
/inventory activities.  
In October 2022, the group felt the need to have a fully Integrated ERP system and 
PCSoft ERP Solutions Pvt. Ltd. was engaged to provide the same. Integrated 
Enterprise View (IEV) is a flagship product of PCSoft and which was suitably 
configured the meet the need of the above businesses in the year 2022-23 in 
Conference Room Pilot (CRP) phase of the ERP implementation project. After 
multiple rounds of meetings in 2023-24, it was felt necessary that some of the 
customizations are exclusively needed by Kirti Group in-order to Go-live with the 
PCSoft ERP.          
 
Kirti group business is very complex and is difficult to map even by renowned ERP 
vendors because of lot of typical core level changes which no implementation 
partner   would be able to handle. 
PCSoft has provided a total ERP automation solution is by combining our mature 
GUI based version (35 years of legacy) and the latest web version specially 
developed for Kirti group to cover certain typical transactions masters and reports. 
Please note that other than the Bi-directional interface with KISAN- Kirti App all the 
functionalities in the web version can also be done using the mature GUI version.
